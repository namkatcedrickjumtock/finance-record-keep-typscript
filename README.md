## ` TypeScript Notes`

      sudo apt install TypeScript -> for Debian distribution

Typscripts is what we call a Superset of javascript becuase it extends teh functionality of Vanilla javascripts, strongly typed and compiled down to javascript which is much error free or bug free.

### Access Modifiers in TypeScript:

    example: of access Modifiers in Typscripts.

    class person {
        readOnly name: String,
        pricate socialSecNo: Number
        public homeAddress: String
    }

- Public : **Meaning we can change and read the value in or outside the class**
- private: **Meaning only allows changing only inside the class**
- ReadOnly: **Meaning we can read and access the properties inside and outide the class but can't change the value**.

### TypeScript Modularity
Note that only modern browsers supports the es6 module system.
